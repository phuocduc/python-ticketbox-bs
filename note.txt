flow forget password and send email
- not logged in
- provide email via a form
- we have to check the availability of email
- generate a token
- send email with a token to that user 
- prepare a page to verify token =>
form to collect new password

personal note:
create 2 blueprint.route: forget password (ask for reset password) and reset password (after reset password)

- def forgetpassword: 
code:
s = URLSafeTimedSerializer(app.secret_key)
token = s.dumps(user.email, salt="RESET_PASSWORD")
send_email(token,user.email)
- def resetpassword: 
code:
s = URLSafeTimedSerializer(app.secret_key)
email = s.loads(token, salt="RESET_PASSWORD", max_age=300)
